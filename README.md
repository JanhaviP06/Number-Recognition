# Number-Recognition
This repository provides an implementation of number recognition using neural networks with the MNIST dataset.

**Description**

Number recognition is a classic machine learning task that involves identifying handwritten numbers. In this project, we utilize neural networks to train a model that can accurately classify digits.

**Dataset**

The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. It consists of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. The dataset is widely used for training and testing machine learning models for number recognition.

The dataset can be downloaded from the official MNIST website or by using the tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist module.

**Usage**

To use the Number Recognition model, follow these steps:

* Open the Number_Recognition.ipynb file in juypter notebook.
* Modify the training parameters if desired, such as the number of epochs or the batch size.
* Run the script to start the model training.
* Once the training is completed, you can use the trained model to predict numbers.
